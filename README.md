# Linearly ðŸ§®
Python implementation of Linear Algebra concepts

### Why
I took a [Linear Algebra class](https://nusmods.com/modules/MA1101R/linear-algebra-i) this semester in college and was really intrigued by the various operations and concepts involved. Here, I try to implement these concepts one by one. You can think of it as a highly-discounted reimplementation of MATLAB.

### Operations and Concepts
- [x] Matrix Operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication)
- [x] Matrix Transformations (transpose)
- [ ] Gaussian Elimination (Consistency checking)
- [ ] Gauss-Jordan Elimination
- [ ] Matrix Inverse and Adjoint
- [ ] Linear Independency checking
- [ ] Subspace Basis calculation
- [ ] Ranks, Dimensions, Nullity
- [ ] Gram-Schmidt Process
- [ ] Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors calculation
- [ ] Characteristic Polynomial calculation
- [ ] Diagonalisation
- [ ] Orthongonal Diagonalisation

> Note: This list will continue to grow as I learn new things. Stay tuned!

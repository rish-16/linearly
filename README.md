# Linearly ðŸ§®
Python implementation of Linear Algebra concepts

### Why
I've taken a [Linear Algebra class]() this semester in college and was really intrigued by the various operations and concepts involved. Here, I try to implement these concepts one by one.

### Operations and Concepts
- [ ] Matrix Operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication)
- [ ] Matrix Transformations (inverse,transpose)
- [ ] Gaussian Elimination (Consistency checking)
- [ ] Gauss-Jordan Elimination
- [ ] Linear Independency checking
- [ ] Subspace Basis calculation
- [ ] Ranks, Dimensions, Nullity
- [ ] Inner Products
- [ ] Gram-Schmidt Process
- [ ] Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors calculation
- [ ] Characteristic Polynomial calculation
- [ ] Diagonalisation
- [ ] Orthongonal Diagonalisation

> Note: This list will continue to grow as I learn new things. Stay tuned!
